.SH NOTES

Hexagonrpcd serves files to the remote processor via a reverse tunnel interface
to the remote processor. These files are by default searched for in:

These files are searched for in a directory tree, starting at the location
defined by the -R option, or in /usr/share/qcom by default:

.TS
l l

l l. 
HexagonRPCD file/dir    Android file/dir
acdb                    /vendor/etc/acdbdata
dsp                     /vendor/dsp
sensors/config          /vendor/etc/sensors/config
sensors/registry        /mnt/vendor/persist/sensors/registry/registry
sensors/sns_reg.conf    /vendor/etc/sensors/sns_reg_config
socinfo                 /sys/devices/soc0
.TE

These files and directories should be populated with files from your device's
Android firmware.

If you can pass the -R option, the convention is to pass -R
/usr/share/qcom/SOC/VENDOR/DEVICE, where SOC is the SoC name in lowercase,
VENDOR is the capitalized name of the device vendor, and DEVICE is the device
name (e.g. -R /usr/share/qcom/sdm845/SHIFT/axolotl or -R
/usr/share/qcom/sdm845/Thundercomm/db845c).
